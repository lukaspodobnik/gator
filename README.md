A simple CLI-based news & blog aggregator built with Go and PostgreSQL.

---

## Requirements
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

---

## Installation
Clone the repository and build the binary:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gator.git
cd gator
go install
```

## Configuration
You will have to manually create a PostgreSQL database called **gator**. Run the migrations in `sql/schema` (in order).

Gator requires a config file in your home directory:
`~/.gatorconfig.json`

It must look like this:
```
{
    "db_url": "connection_string"
}
```

The <connection_string> looks like this:
```
"postgres://username:@localhost:5432/gator?sslmode=disable"
```

Make sure to use your username and test the connection with:
```bash
psql <connection_string>
```

Run commands with:
`gator <command> [arguments]`
